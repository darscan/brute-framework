h2. The Brute Framework (A Wrecking Ball)

h3. Intro

If you're going to screw around with statics you may as well go ALL THE WAY.

h3. Usage

No imports, just grab a Brute:

<pre>
Brute.get('MyApp').something = "hello world!";
</pre>

Each Brute is a Dynamic Sprite (oh sick!):

<pre>
var brute:Brute = Brute.get('MyApp');

brute.something = "hi";

brute.addEventListener('boom!', function(e:Event):void {
  trace(e.target.something);
});
brute.dispatchEvent(new Event('boom!'));
</pre>
